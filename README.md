# Bulldozer_price_prediction_project
Project Summary: Bulldozer Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aimed to predict the sale price of bulldozers using historical sales data from Kaggle. The data included a variety of features such as model type, size, and sale date, and was divided into training, validation, and test sets.

Key Points:

Problem Definition: The project focused on building a model to accurately estimate the future sale price of bulldozers based on their characteristics and past sales data.
Data: The project utilized a time-series dataset from Kaggle, consisting of over 400,000 historical bulldozer sales examples.
Evaluation: The primary evaluation metric was the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE). The goal was to minimize this error to achieve better predictions.
Features: Kaggle provided a data dictionary to help understand the meaning of each feature in the dataset.
Baseline Model: The initial step involved building a basic model to establish a baseline performance against which future models could be compared.
Next Steps (Potential):

Feature Engineering: Explore different ways to transform and combine features to potentially improve model performance.
Model Selection: Experiment with various regression algorithms within scikit-learn (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to find the best fit for the data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model's parameters to further enhance its predictive accuracy.
Model Evaluation: Thoroughly evaluate the model's performance on the validation set and compare it to the Kaggle leaderboard to gauge its competitiveness.
